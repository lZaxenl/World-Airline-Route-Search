This program runs off a menu system so we can get the 20 points extra credit.

There are 4 different flight graphs that you can choose from in the menu options.
The first part will ask you how many cities you want in the graph. Enter one of 
the numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4 to pick which graph you want.

Next it will ask which question from the project you want to run. Again, enter one of 
numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4 to run a question. Or, enter 5 to quit the program.

Every time you need to pick a city, the program will output a list of possible cities
to choose from. Enter the number located to the left of the city you want to choose.
